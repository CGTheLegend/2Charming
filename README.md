2Charming is a Dual Ended Side-Scrolling Puzzle Platform developed for a Game Design course at The University of California Santa Cruz. It was developed by a small team of students in 2013 with much love, ambition and some tears. The game stars two characters, the Prince and Princess who are on opposite ends of the level with the goal of meeting in the middle. They both specialize in unique skills. The Prince is quick and can attack while the Princess is nimble and can build. Utilize both of their skills to have them both meet up in the middle.
